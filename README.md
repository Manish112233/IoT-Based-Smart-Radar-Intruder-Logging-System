📡 Smart Radar & Intruder Logging System 🛡️An integrated IoT-style security solution that combines real-time hardware sensing with a Python-based web dashboard. This project uses an ultrasonic sensor to scan a $180^\circ$ field and logs every detection with a precise timestamp on a live web interface.🚀 Features$180^\circ$ Area Scanning: Automated sweep using a high-torque SG90 Servo.Dual-Layer Alert System: Simultaneous physical (Buzzer + LED) and digital (Web Log) alerts.Live Web Dashboard: A Flask-powered interface that displays detection history.Intelligent Logging: Captures exact Time, Angle, and Distance of intruders.CSV Data Stream: Optimized Serial communication between Arduino and Python.🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: C++ (Arduino Sketch), Python 3.xHardware: * Arduino Uno R3HC-SR04 Ultrasonic SensorSG90 Micro ServoActive Buzzer & LEDsSoftware Frameworks: * Flask: To host the local web server.PySerial: To bridge the gap between Hardware and OS.🔌 Circuit MappingComponentArduino PinUltrasonic Trig/EchoPin 8 / Pin 9Servo SignalPin 10BuzzerPin 13Red LED (Alert)Pin 7Green LED (Safe)Pin 6💻 Installation & Setup1. Arduino ConfigurationOpen radar_system.ino in the Arduino IDE.Upload the code to your Arduino Uno.Crucial: Close the Serial Monitor after uploading.2. Python EnvironmentInstall the required dependencies:Bashpip install flask pyserial
3. Running the DashboardConnect your Arduino via USB.Run the Python script:Bashpython radar_web.py
Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:5000📈 Project LogicThe system functions through a three-step pipeline:Sensing: The Arduino pulses the Ultrasonic sensor at specific angles provided by the Servo.Transmission: Raw data is converted into a string format angle,distance and sent via Serial.Visualization: Python parses the string, attaches a system timestamp, and pushes it to the HTML template using Jinja2 rendering.👤 AuthorYour Name Full-stack Electronics Enthusiast www.linkedin.com/in/manish-joshi-19308139a
